# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to ensure consistency and the standard application of practices when designing and implementing API's at AMRP. It details the requirements, conventions and best practices on how to create an API that is maintainable, extensible, discoverable and consistent. This facilitates a great developer experience and the ability to quickly compose business processes.  

# Preamble
AMRP's software architecture is designed to encapsulate small pieces of business value in  microservices that expose functionality via RESTful APIs with a JSON payloads. In no other part of the organization are business capabilities expressed as precisely and fully as in our API's. As such, our API's our highly valuable business assets, both as the interface into our business capabilities, and as living documentation of the value we are delivering.

This makes designing high quality, long lasting API's a mission critical endeavor to the organization of the utmost importance. To facilitate creating API's that fulfill the above criteria, this living document must be used to assure a consistent, durable approach to designing API's within Airmiles 

# Document Semantics, Formatting, and Naming
The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The words "REST" and "RESTful" MUST be written as presented here, representing the acronym as all upper-case letters. This is also true of "JSON," "XML," and other acronyms.

Machine-readable text, such as URLs, HTTP verbs, and source code, are represented using a fixed-width font.

URIs containing variable blocks are specified according to URI Template RFC 6570. For example, a URL containing a variable called account_id would be shown as https://foo.com/accounts/{account_id}.

HTTP headers are written in title case + hyphenated syntax, e.g. Foo-Request-Id.


# General Guidlines

[**MUST** follow API first principle](#api-first-principle)


MUST provide API specification using OpenAPI

|HTTP Method|Description|
|---|---|
| `GET`| To _retrieve_ a resource. |
| `POST`| To _create_ a resource, or to _execute_ a complex operation on a resource. |
| `PUT`| To _update_ a resource. |
| `DELETE`| To _delete_ a resource. |
| `PATCH`| To perform a _partial update_ to a resource. |
